# private-events

Simon Tharby's [UNFINISHED] solution to [Project 2: Private Events](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations), Associations section, Ruby on Rails unit, Odin Project.

## Instructions:

"... build a site similar to a private [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations [to] parties (sound familiar?). Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like “Andy’s House”).

A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. This will require you to model many-to-many relationships and also to be very conscious about your foreign keys and class names (hint: you won’t be able to just rely on Rails’ defaults like you have before)."
